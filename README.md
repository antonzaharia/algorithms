# HackerRank

This repository contains interesting algorithms I find out and might be useful in my future work.
I used Test-driven development (Rspec) to check my results.

#

I started solving problems as a way to practice my algorithms skills in Ruby and Javascript.

#

The files contain my way of solving the problems.
